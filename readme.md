# C Standard Template Library (STL) Implementations in C

This repository contains the implementation of C++ STL libraries like hashmap, queue, linked list, stack in the C programming language. The aim is to provide similar functionalities to C++ STL, but in C, making it easier to use these data structures in C projects.

## Implementations

- **Hashmap**: A hash table implementation with collision handling using separate chaining.
- **Queue**: A queue data structure implemented using linked lists and arrays.
- **Linked List**: A singly/doubly linked list implementation with basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Stack**: A stack implementation using arrays and linked lists, supporting push, pop, and peek operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use these libraries, you'll need a C compiler like `gcc`. 

### Installation

**Installation steps are added in each folder. Have look there :)**
